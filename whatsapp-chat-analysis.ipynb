Academics is one of the several factors that are part of overall candidacy. Masters from a reputed school definitely adds  more weight and probably helps in stiff competition to be short listed for interview but I think the benefit ends there from an application process .The interview performance and one\\'s overall candidacy and many other factors often uncontrollable determine the outcome. So masters from France is fine but I would suggest make sure it is equivalent to US master from an accredition and has decent reputation.\\n[10/16/22, 8:19:59 AM] \\u202a+1\\xa0(713)\\xa0205‑4431\\u202c: Thanks for the detailed info Sri!\\n[10/16/22, 8:50:47 AM] \\u202a+1\\xa0(713)\\xa0205‑4431\\u202c: I think it is recognized in US 🤔 the school is IESEG school of management, they seem to have quite a few accreditations.
